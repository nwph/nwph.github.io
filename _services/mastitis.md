## What causes mastitis?

Usually a blocked duct or incomplete emptying of milk from the breast will cause mastitis. This can be due to poor attachment to the breast by the infant, ill-fitting/tight bra or crop top or nipple damage.

## Mastitis symptoms

You may feel like you have the flu, feeling unwell with aches and feeling hot and cold. Your breast may have a red, sore area. It may feel hard and hot.

### Mastitis treatment

Continue to feed your baby/express milk from the affected breast. Use warmth over the affected area prior to feeding/expressing. At other times you can use something cool in the area for comfort. Gentle massage of the area while feeding/expressing can help to unblock a duct. If symptoms arenâ€™t resolving you may need to see your GP for a course of antibiotics. Advice from a lactation consultant may be helpful if poor attachment is a contributing factor.

### Physiotherapy for Mastitis

[Physiotherapy treatment](/book-appointment/) may involve therapeutic ultrasound to help reduce inflammation, kinesio taping, and advice about home management.
