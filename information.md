# General Appointment Information

Initial (one hour) and follow up (30 mins) appointments are available, these can be in person in the Gollan St ELPE Health clinic or via telehealth.

Home Visits may be available if you are unable to attend the clinic in person (e.g for mastitis) please use the [contact form](/contact/) to organise a home visit. Appointments can be made by calling ELPE Health on [03 6425 6901](tel:+61364256901).

HICAPS rebates are available if you have private health insurance cover for extras. Speak directly to your fund for more details. Medicare funded appointments are available if your GP has filled out the appropriate paperwork (Chronic Disease Management Plan - formerly EPC plan) and this has been sent through to the clinic. Note there is a gap payment charged on top of the medicare rebate. NDIS funding can be used for appointments as long as there is prior approval from case managers and appropriate paperwork has been sent through before making an appointment.

Payment for appointments/equipment must be made on the day of service. Notice for cancellation is required at least 24 hours prior to your appointment time. If insufficient notice is given and there are not extenuating circumstances, you may be charged for your appointment.

## Prior to Your Appointment

Please arrive 5-10 minutes before your initial appointment to allow you adequate time to fill in your new patient registration and pelvic floor questionnaire. Please bring with you any doctors or specialist referrals that you might have, or imaging reports if relevant.

A referral is not needed for a physiotherapy appointment, however we welcome any relevant information from medical practitioners.

## At Your Appointment

Children/family members/carers are welcome to attend appointments with you, however with the presence of COVID in our community, please limit the number of people coming with you to your appointment, so we can abide by density limits.

Surgical masks must be worn to appointments. Please cancel your appointment if you or anyone accompanying you to your appointment have any cold and flu symptoms.

Please wear loose/stretchy clothing for ease movement during physical assessment. Your Physiotherapist will take a comprehensive medical history from you during your appointment. This may include (where applicable) questions about bladder/bowel/sexual function as well as obstetric and gynaecological history. You do not have to answer any questions that you are uncomfortable with, however it may help your
physio guide your assessment and treatment.

Physical examination may include the external structures of the pelvis/abdomen and lower back, as well as the pelvic floor. The pelvic floor can be assessed using real time ultrasound, a visual assessment of the pelvic floor without your clothes on, or a internal vaginal or rectal examination. Participation in any aspect of the assessment is always your choice and your Physiotherapist will explain all options to you.

Internal examination when you have your period is still possible if you are comfortable to do so. Please let your Physiotherapist know your preferences at any time. We are committed to ensuring your experience is as comfortable as possible.
