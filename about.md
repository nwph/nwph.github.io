At NWP health we believe all people, regardless of their location, should be able to access the health services they need.

Pelvic health issues can significantly affect quality of life and unfortunately many people do not or cannot access help. NWPH values providing quality, evidence based care in a comfortable and safe environment.

## Georgie Palmer - Director/Physiotherapist

Georgie grew up on the North West coast of Tassie before moving to the mainland to study a Bachelor of Physiotherapy at La Trobe university. She subsequently completed her Post Graduate Certificate in Exercise Science (Strength and Conditioning) from Edith Cowan University. She has worked at locations across Queensland and Tasmania before making the move to start her business, North West Pelvic Health.

Georgie has 14 years experience working in private practice physiotherapy, previously working with musculoskeletal injuries, chronic health conditions and ante/post natal populations before developing an interest in pelvic health physiotherapy after having her own children. She has completed numerous pelvic health courses to allow her to assess and treat the pelvic floor, and is committed to working towards becoming a titled APA Women’s Men’s and Pelvic health physiotherapist.

Georgie is registered with AHPRA and a member of the Australian Physiotherapy Association.

Georgie is passionate about providing evidence based care in a comfortable and relaxed environment. She enjoys working with pelvic health clients as it is rewarding work helping them achieve better quality of life.

Georgie hopes to empower her clients with the education required to improve strength, regain control and reduce pain. She understands that the nature of her work is intimate and is respectful of the trust clients put in her by accessing her service and sharing their story.

Georgie helps clients with pelvic floor training, prolapse management, bladder and bowel issues, painful intercourse, conditions related to pregnancy, post natal rehabilitation (including abdominal and pelvic floor rehab) and treatment for mastitis/blocked ducts.
